\description{
A data set containing the annual (calendar year) intervening natural flow at 29 locations 
in the Colorado River Basin 1906 through 2012.
}
\details{
Natural flow represents the flow that would have  occurred at a location, had 
depletions and reservoir regulation not been present upstream of that location. 
The total natural flow represents the total flow in the entire basin above a given 
gage. The intervening natural flow represents only the flow that originates 
upstream of a given gage, but below all upstream gage locations.

The natural flows are recomputed annually and are subject
to change without notice. All methods are fully desribed at 
\url{http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/NaturalFlow/current.html}.

Summing \code{\link{monthlyInt}} each year from January 1906 through December 2012
will equal these data.

Each of the 29 locations are represented by one variable (column). The variable
names use a shorthand name of each gage location, e.g., \code{LeesFerry} is
shorthand for the "Colorado River at Lees Ferry, AZ". See \code{CRSSIO::nfGageNames()}
for full gage names, and \code{CRSSIO::nfShortNames()} for the shorthand version used
to name the variables in these data.

The data includes xts attributes (\code{xtsAttributes(monthlyTot)}) for the
source, the source workbook, and the sheet name the data were created from.
